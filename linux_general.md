"it's more of a manual that a set of challenges though. For that i'd recommend Project Euler if you want to practice programming in bash (if you're that deranged)"

"You could also give Linux From Scratch a look. It teaches you to set up a linux OS from the ground up, without any pesky tools."

"A bit of awk, sed, grep and sort is basically all you need really"

"Take a file, mix it with another, sort it and then calculate some aggregates"

"du -s * | sort -nr > $HOME/user_space_report.txt

Add to a cronjob, run daily

shows you who on your server uses the most space. Simple and basic, but works"


"Or do some dumps of /proc"

"I don't see the need for automatic process info retrieval

but it's something you could do for like a text editor or something, see how the memory allocations change and shit

I imagine it would be an interesting and special kind of depressing to compare memory usage across different editors

like ed/nano/vim/emacs/atom/vs code"
